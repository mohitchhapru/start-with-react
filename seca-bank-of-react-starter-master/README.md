# Bank of React Starter Code

> Note: You do not need to touch the API code. All user stories can be completed
without changing the API.

## Starting Up

The API lives here: https://git.generalassemb.ly/ed-product-library/seca-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/seca-react/react-router/bank-of-react-api

Clone the repo, then inside of the repo run the following commands to start up:

```
npm install

npm start
```

## Starting the React App

Run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start the React app.

The app will start up on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and 
is already set up to proxy API requests to the database.
